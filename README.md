Data Structure 


The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between contact persons. To prevent the diffusion of virus, vaccination is a secure and effective way. Thanks for the scientistsâ€™ hard work. To better manage the information and fight with the epidemic, we need to record the information of people who have get vaccinated. The key information to be recorded for each vaccinated person include personal identity number, name, telephone, age, gender, address and date of vaccination. 

1.	Now choose a data structure to save and manipulate the information of the people who have get vaccinated. Please describe which data structure (both logical structure and physical structure) you will choose to save the vaccinated-people information and explain why.


3.	Please define the element type for the vaccinated people, which encapsulates all information of personal identity number, name, telephone, age, gender, address and date of vaccination.


5.	When a new person get vaccinated, what should you do to add him/her to the vaccinated person information pool? Please describe your idea and write down the algorithms.
